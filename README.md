# Simple Java Swing Calculator

## Introduction
This project is a simple calculator built with Java Swing to demonstrate the practical use of the Strategy design pattern in creating a user-friendly graphical interface for performing basic arithmetic operations. It's designed to provide a clear example of implementing GUI applications in Java while showcasing the flexibility of the Strategy pattern in operation selection.

## Features
- **Basic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Utilizes the Strategy design pattern to dynamically choose the operation to perform based on user input.
- **Swing GUI**: Features a simple and intuitive graphical user interface made with Java Swing.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles division by zero and invalid input scenarios.
- **Extendable**: Designed for easy addition of more operations or features.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **GUI Framework**: Java Swing
- **Design Pattern**: Strategy Pattern

## How It Works
The calculator uses the Strategy pattern to encapsulate addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. Each operation is defined as a strategy, and the calculator dynamically selects the appropriate strategy based on the user's choice.

## Setup and Installation
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your machine (Java 8 or newer is recommended).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Compile the Java files using your favorite IDE or the command line.
4. Run the application. The GUI should appear, ready for use.

## How to Use
1. Enter the first number in the designated field.
2. Select the desired arithmetic operation.
3. Enter the second number in the next field.
4. Press the "=" button to perform the operation and display the result.
